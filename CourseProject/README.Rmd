Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data
=====================================
> The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

> One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
> 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps to reproduce this project
-------------------------------

The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:
  
1. Downloads & extracts the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory.
2. Load the activity and feature files.
3. Loads both the training and test datasets.
4. Creates unique merge key on training and test data .
5. Merges the training and test data sets.
6. Merges measurement data with subjects & activity lablels.
7. Adds feature names to variables.
8. Subset data with mean or std observations.
9. Rename feature names to make more readable.
10.Creates a  dataset that consists of the mean value of each variable for each subject, ActivityNum, and ActivityName grouping.
11. The script will produce two files.  `FinalDataSet.txt` which combines training and test sets with mean & std variables and `FinalMeanDataSet.txt` contains dataset with the mean of each variable for each subject, ActivityNum, and ActivityName.
